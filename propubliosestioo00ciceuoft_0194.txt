“160 PRO P. SESTIO ἓξ 60-62

1. 13. extraordinarias potestates] Gato’s commission was
extraordinaria inasmuch as (1) h'e was Immo privatus, having
been quaestor only and tribune of the people‚ (2) because it
was given him nominatim (or. de dom. sua §212 ad hunc homi-
nem imperium extra ordinem ‘nominatim royatione tua de-
tulisti), (3) because it combined two different objects (Plut. Cato
c. 34 ὡς δὲ μικρὸν ἔργον αὐτῷ Κύπρον καὶ Πτολεμαῖον ἀναθεὶς ἔτι

καὶ Βυζαντίων φυγάδας κατέχειν προσέταξε βουλόμενος ὅτι πλεῖστον
χρόνον ἐκποδὼν ἄρχοντος αὐτοῦ γενέσθαι τὸν Κάτωνα).

personal mfluenoe ' in opposition to voce ipsa ac dolore, ‘ loud

1. 19. post meum discessum] Plutarch therefore must be
mistaken, when he says ὁ δὲ Κλώδιος οὐδὲ Κικέρωνα καταλύσειν
ἤλπιζε Κάτωνος παρόντος.

ὅ 3ἐ. ἔρῃ ΙΠῖιᾷε] ξ 26 1,. 19. meum et rei publicae casum]

senon. BOB. Of. Dio 38, 7. Plutarch Cat. c. 32 says that there
was a clause in the land bill, by which all the senators were
required to swear that they would maintain it and we leam
from a letter of Cic. (ad Att. 11 18) that candidates for state
offices were also compelled by the land bill to swear that they
would never say anything about the land being held on any
other terms than those fixed by the Julian laws (see Introd. to
or. p. Planc. p. xm). He then continues: ὁ δὲ μάλιστα συμ-
