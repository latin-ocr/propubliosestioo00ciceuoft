in or. Ρ. Clu. ἕ 93, or. p. Flacco §66, are supposed to have
been a flight of steps leading up to the raised dais of this
TribunaL which was in the Forum near the Temple of
Castor. The whole structure is supposed to have been the
work of M. Aurelius Cotta, cos. Β.0. 74. [Is there not an
allusion to the use of the phrase in the sense ‘officially'? Ι
do not think this reference is barred by the addition of

Aurelio. J. s. R.]

1. 24. nomine collegiorum, ‘ as if his object were to form
street-clubs.’ The collegia which were restored by P. Clodius
in Β.0. 58, after they had been suppressed by the senate in Β.0.
68, were the compitalicia, such as the inhabitants of the same
compitum formed, connected with the worship of the lares
compitales. It was found that the action of such organised
bodies of men could be made very efficient for political
purposes, and threatened disturbances of social order. To
pave the way for their re-introduction‚ one of the tribunes in
· 13.0. 61 endeavoured to celebrate the games connected with
the festival (ludi compitalicii): but he was prevented by
Q. Metellus Celer the consul elect. But three years afterwards
Clodius succeeded in reviving them and three days subsequently
carried his bill de collegiis restituendis novisque instituendis.
Cicero was for some time under the delusion that he was a
gainer by this enactment‚ on the ground that he and his friends
might have their hired partisans as well as Clodius. See my
