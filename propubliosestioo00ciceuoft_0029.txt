to 1οροΙ force with force.

g 24. Clodius was still powerful enough through
the influence of his friends to carry his election as
curule Aedile, but not until the twenty-second os
January Rc. 56, owing to the long postponement of
the comitia in the consulate of On. Cornelius Lentulus
Marcellinus and L. Marcius Philippus. The first
thing that 110 did was 10 commence a prosecution
before the people against Milo, whose tribunate had
ended on the tenth of December Β. ο. 57, for disturb-
ing the public peace (de vi³ ⁸, quod qladiatores adhi-

bui-sset, ut royationem posset de Cicerone perferrem),
i. e. he laid a charge against him for committing the „,

very same offence which he was himself guilty of

and for which he had been prosecuted by Milo. This ἓν,

why he brought this charge before the popular assembly is
probably because on the 2nd of February the iudices had 1101

the election of magistrates„ This will explain a passage in
Dion who remarks 39, 19 ὁ ’γὰρ Κλώδιος ὅπως ἐπὶ πλεῖον ἀποροίη
(Pompeius) οὐκ εἴα. τὸν φρατριατικὸν νόμον ἐσαχθῆναι (1.0. he
would not allow the lex curiata de imperio to be passed, with-
out which no court of justice could be constituted, and which
was essential because it conferred the imperium and the auspi·
cia (Liv. v 52, 15, Cic. de leg. agr. 11 ἓ 30); πρὶν ’γὰρ ἐκεῖνον τε-
θῆναι, οὔτ’ ἄλλο τι τῶν σπουδαίων ἐν τῷ κοινῷ πραχθῆναι οὔτε
δίκην οὐδεμίαν ἐσαχθῆναι ἐξῆν.
