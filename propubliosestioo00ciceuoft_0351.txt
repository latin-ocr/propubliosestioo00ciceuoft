THE HIERON oF XENOPHON. 'The text:

adapted for the use of Schools, with Introduction, Sum-
manes, Critical and Explanatory Notes and Indexes by

the Rev. H. A. Honnms, M.A., LL.D. 33. 6d. Third
Edition. (Macmillan’s Classical Series)

“The Hiero of Xenophon, by the ReV. Hubert A. Holden, is an edition
for which everything that care and industry, and a scholarship that is very
seldom at fault, could do has been done. ἤ * ἤ There is much valuahle
matter in the notes, δια, which should have abearing and a use be ond the
book itself. In this work Teachers will often want help, and Dr Hol en is an
editor admirably fitted for giving it.”-Spectator, March 1, 1884.

“This is a third edition of Dr Holden's well-known edition of one of
Xenophon's most graceful minor works. Like its predecessors. this volume
must be welcome to scholars-old and young alike. 'l'he dialogue is admirably
suited to school purposes, and, the only objection that could be raised to its
use having been removed in this edition, the learned and indefatigable editor
hopes that its present form will secure it a more favourable reception. ἥ ³* ⁴‘ The
explanatory notes have, indeed, been throughout carefully revised‚ but new
matter has been added. The monograp'ns on the two interlocutors have been
made still more complete. The third part of the introduction on the τυραννίς
has been re-written and, as we think, improved, while the critical discussion os
MSS has been brought up to date, 50 as to include a history of Prof-
C. Schenkl's fresh collation of 14 MSS. The Greek Index, also, is much
improved ὕ '⁶ ἦ ⁴* ἥ ἥ We congratulate, not only the bo 5, but their masters, on
the acquisition of this Book.”-Journat os Education‚ ec. 1, 1888.

“Any edition by Dr Holden of a classical author is sure to be scholarly,
and any work which he undertakes is sure to be thoroughly and conscientiousl y
done. For proof of this, one need look no farther than the present volume.
’θ ³* ἅ 11 would be difficult to speak too highly of much of the comment
and criticism contained in the notes. There is a valuable Appendix on the
text, while the indexes are, so sar as we have tested them, unusually com-

plete.”-Journal of Education, J an. 1, 1884.

“Dr Holden deserves the gratitude of all Schoolmasters for drawing
their attention to this charming treatise by an edition so thorough and
scholarly. '⁶ * ἥ Any boy who will take the trouble to master Dr Holden’s
notes, will have laid a. good foundation of Greek Scholarship sor himself.
Altogether, the book is worthy of Dr Holden's reputation as a Scholar and a
practical Teacher.”—The Educ-attonat Times, J an. 1, 1884.

‘⁶ candidates sor a Degree will find Dr Holdeu’s notes extremely useful
and well chosen. His references to grammar-s are just what men want at that
stage 01111011· reading.”—Academy‚ Nov. 24, 1883.

“As Μι- Holden has shown in his admirable Plutarch’s Themistocles, 110
05505505 1110 very best qualities of a commentator. He knows all the modern
fearning on 1115 author-3 he selects with care and discretion and adds from his
own great stores short and really instructive notes. Whenever the silly pre—
‚iudices of narrow teachers about Plutarch's Greek are dis elled, and the
matter which boys leam is regarded as of some importante, t is earlier book
will take the highest place as a school book. The Hieron is equally good.
⁴* * ⁴* We are promised the charming oeconomicus from 1110 same master
hand.”-cm2cemporary Review‚ Dec. 1883.
