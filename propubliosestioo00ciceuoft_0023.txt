from Rome, the rogation of Clodius received the sanc-

latter the rich province of Asia, in defiance of the
Zea: Semproniam. On this day also Clodius presented
to the Comitia a privileyium in the nature 'of a bill

obiect of Clodius was only to drive Cicero away and that was
effected by the second bill which contained his name and no
other. Long Rom. Rep. 111 p. 457.
