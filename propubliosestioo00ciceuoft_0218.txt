templum castoris] This was the temple as rebuilt by L. Metellus

Dalmaticus consul nc. 119, which formed one of the most conspicuous obj ects
of the Forum. lt was frequently used for meetings of the senate (Cic. or. in
Verr. 11 1 5 129), and in turbulent times became a position of great olitical
importance. Its ten-ace and steps served the purpose of Rostra, w enever

opular assemblies were held, as was frequently the case, in front of it. It was

ere that the consuls Sulla and Q. Pompeius Rufus were attacked in n. c. 88 by
the tribune Sulpicius and the Mai-ian faction. It was the scene of the contest
between Cato and Metellus respecting the recall of Pompeius from Asia (Plut,
Cato min. c. 28). It was here that in n. c. 59 the consul Bibulus, when ο posing
the agrarian law of his colleague Caesar, was pushed down the steps an driven
from the Forum. It was this temple which Clodius occupied with his armed
followers, and made it, in the language of Cicero, arx civium perditorum .......
castellum sorensis latrocinii, bustum leyum omnium ac reliyionum (or. in Pis
5 11). Lastly it was from the steps of this temple that Octavianus and the
tribune Canutius harangued the people against Antonius (Appian bell. εἰν. 111
41). It was again rebuilt in the time of Augustus, and the existing marble

columns are probably a relic of this restoration, Nichols’ Roman Forum,
