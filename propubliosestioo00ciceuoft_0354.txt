“This splendid edition of a school-book contains an Introduction, Notes and
an Excursus on the Text3 and—invaluable adj unct—a complete Lexical Index-

“ Dr Holden has now added another to the many obligations under which he
has laid teachers of the classica by sending out this edition, a work marked, we

learned editors, always gives his readers of the best....The ‘ Lexical In ex’ will
be found on examination to be something very different from the ordinary
vocabulary. It is a complete concordance to the treatise‚ and not only this, but
marks the peculiarities of Xenophontean diction. We are sure that a student
of considerable attainments might profit greatly by a careful study of this part
of Dr Holden's edition. The notes are remarkably complete as regards the
three points of exegesis, illustration and grammatical comment....Teachers,
whose missortune it is that they seldom have time to read, ought to feel in-
finitely obliged to the guidance and help which an editor such as Dr Holden
affords.''—Spectat0r‚ Nov. 1, 1884.

“The edition is admirably got up in every way. We hope many will be led
to αάοὲι as a school class-book a Treatise which is at once so interesting and so
well a apted for the purpose. —Nonconsormzst, Oct. 4, 1884.

“The Oeconomicus of Xenophon has long been a favourite book to read, or,
at least, to read about....Yet, like the Hieron (ΑοΑυΕΜῩ, N ov. 23, 1883), it had
never, till Dr Holden took it in hand, been edited in English. Translated of
course it had been, though not with remarkable accuracy. Dr Holden has
lavished great labour on his edition, and succeeded in making it very complete
and helpful. The Lexical Index of all the words in all their uses (in which the
article ο. takes thirteen columns) would alone justify both these epithets; but
the commentary also is almost exhaustive....We hope it is Dr Holden's intention

to edit some more of the less read treatises which bear Xenophon’s name.”-
Academy, Feb. 7, 1885.

“Α student may readily and easily master the ‘Oeconomicus ⁹ with the aid of
Mr Holden's and without the aid of any other book, lexical or grammaticaL
whatsoever.”—St J ame-§⁸⁹⁸ Gazette, Oct. 20, 1884.

“ The edition as a whole reflects the utmost credit upon both the scholarship
and industry of Dr Holden.”—Birmin9ham Daily Gazette, Oet. 17, 1884.

“Like all Dr Holden’s previous work, it bears the impress of accurate and
finished scholarship.”—lee Schoolmaster, Nov. 8, 1884.

“Dr Holden has done well to bring his wide knowledge, his practical ex-

lace among the leading editions. True, Dr Holden keeps the beginner steadily
Bi view, but, while he explains all the syntactical phaenomena that are re-
cognized in Goodwin’s Greek Gramma»- by references to that popular manual,
the results of special research as recorded in more elaborate treatises or in
scattered monographs have been brought within the reach of the reader‚ and the
more advanced student is thus reminded of the gaps in his knowledge, and is
stimulated to observe more narrowly. The complete lexical index 1s a valuable
addition to the book. Dr Holden has passed over very little that is worth
noticing, and one cannot be too grateful ιο an editor who leads the student to
think of the stylistic effect of vocabulary and grammar. The sub eet-matter of
the Oeconomicus is abundantly illustrated‚ and the vision ο antique life
widened by the commentas-5:221 merican Journal os Philoloyy, Vol. v. p. 519.
