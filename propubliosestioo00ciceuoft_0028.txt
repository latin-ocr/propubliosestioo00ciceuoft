even after the return of Cicero. On the twelfth of
November Clodius attempted to take possession of
and burn Milo's house in the Germalus, and Milo
was compelled to bring an action against him for
disturbance of the peace under the lex Plautia de vi.
Clodius made vigorous efforts to obtain the aedileship‚
in the hope of eluding by this means the process with
which he was threatened. He could not be brought
to trial before the election to the aedileship was
decided‚ on the ground that the quaestors37, whose

duty it was to determine the iudices by lot, were not

the praetor to admit any prosecution before the jurors
were appointed. Now, as the election of aediles pre-

πρὸς αὐτοὺς Κλώδιος, ἀλλ’ ἐκείνῳ τε ὃ Μίλων οἰντέκειτο ὥστε
μηδὲν βίαιον δρᾶσαι καὶ τῷ νόμῳ ἄλλοι τε καὶ ὁ Πομπήιος συνεῖ-
