Cicero here enters into a lony explanation of his motives for '

quittiny the field to his enemies, and a justification of himself
ayainst the charye of cowardice.

He had with him, he says, not only all the best but much
the yreatest part of the city, de'termined to run all hazards and
expose their lives for his safety, and was more than a match sor
all the strenyth of Clodius and the two consuls; and sofar he was
in a better position than-Q. Caecilius Me tellus when he volun-

ἷιὲιέίέί ωέὲςῑάνεω from the city rather than risk disturbances
ο- .

But it was the attitude of the triumvir-ate which alarmed
him.- the boast of Clodius that he had their authority sor all
that he did was not contradicted by any of them, and their
silence was virtually a confession os the truth os his assertions ,-
the fact was, they feared the reversat of their acts of the preced-

in9 year if they failed to secure the sriendship of the powersul
tribune (ἐξ 39—40).

The conduct of Pompeius was most discourayiny to him, who,
notwithstanding] his professions of friendship and solemn assur-
ances only the year before, had now reti-red to his Alban villa
from pretendecl friyht at the warninys which the partisans of
. Clodius had whispered into his ear, that his life was threatened
by the machinations os Cicero and his friends ; Caesar was at
the ,qa-tes of the city with an army, in which the brother of
Clodius held a command (ἓ 41).
