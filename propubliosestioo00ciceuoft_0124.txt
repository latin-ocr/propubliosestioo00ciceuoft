eo PRO P. SESTIO §g 12-14

ficus usus] ‘ extraordinary experience,’ [Petreius was one of
the old soldier class of the type of Labienus, J. s. 3.] Sallust,
Cat. c. 59 6 quod amplius annos triyinta tribunus aut praefectus
aut leyatus aut praetor cum mayna ⁸qlor‘ia in exercitu fuerat.

1. 14. accusandum] ‘ taking to task,’ ‘reproving’ ξ 1221. 31.

l. 15. datus esset hiemi locus] i.e. bellum hiemi ces-
sisset, hiemis interventu interruptum esset, ‘winter
would have had free course, and the pul-suit of Catiline
would have been interrupted, because he could not under these
circumstances have been dislodged e pruina Appennini atque e
nivibus illis, while in the south he was pressed hard by the
army of Antonius, and in the north his passage to Gaul was
opposed by Q. Metellus Celer, who (Sall. Cat. c. 57) sub ipsis
radicibus montium consedit, qua illi descensus erat in Galliam
properanti. But had Catiline been fortunate in obtaining the
exact time of the year for military operations (aestas) and in
becoming master of the passes of the Apennines leading to
Italy and of the shepherds' huts, his destruction in any case
would have been at the expense of much bloodshed. The
battle of Pistoria, in which Catiline fell fighting against Petreius,
according to the calculation of Ideler (Handb. der Chronologie
11 p. 111) is to be placed in the month of February B.c. 62.

exercitum ducimus conditi nubibus silvisque.

pastorum stabula] Liv. 1 4, 9 nec in stabulis nec ad
pecora seynes i.e. ‘ neither at home nor in the chase.’ From
these half-wild shepherds Catiline might have got a considerable
contingent for his band of followers. Cf. or. in Cat. 1115 14:
idem decretum est in M. Ceparium, cui ad sollicitandos
pastores Apuliam esse attributam erat indicatum. [It is
important to note that these are the ergastula ; cf. or. p. Mur.
