1. 2. auctontate] ‘through the moral weight of your judi-
cial decision.' reug-lone] ‘through the obligation of your
oath‚' which gives a sanctity to your verdict.

1. 3. ego autem, iudices, qua voce utendum putabam cet.]
Halm in ed. 1 adopted Hotoman’s reading quia before qua
voce, which is found in the Bernese mss, but not in 1³3 but,
when Madvig pointed out that Cicero would at least have
written quoniam and not quia, in his later editions he substi-
tuted quoniam. I am inclined to agree with Madvig that
neither quia nor quoniam is required; the sentence eis potissi.
mum vox haec serviat (i.e. servire debet) he thinks is genuine,
in confirmation of the previous ea nunc uti coyor. Bake and
Hirschfelder and Halm in his fifth edition omit the clause
altogether, Wesenberg would read depellendis, iis potissimum
ut vox haec serviat. Mr Reid is strongly in favour of quam-
quam, the drift being ‘although I speak under regrettable
circumstances, still etc.’

1. 5. beneficio] ‘favour,’ meaning his own restoration.

1. 6. periculis] frequently used of the danger threatened
by criminal charges, with reference to the grave penalties
incurred in case of conviction. See Reid n. on p. Arch. ἕ 13.

ἕξ 3-5, Propositio

placed in his present position because of the leadinq part he
took in my recall, and Ι claim the consideration and indulyence
of the court, if in the course of my defence I yive expression
somewhat freely to ‘my sentiments of just indiynation ayainst his
persecutors. I shall beyin with a ,qeneral sketch of his character
and lise, up to the time when he became tribune of the people,
that you may be in possession of full data for determininy the
question of his 9uilt or innocence.

CHAPTER Π
ξ 3, l. 9. a Q. Hortensio—perorata est] ‘has been last

dealt with by Hortensius.' See Introd. ξ 27. In public trials .

there was ordinarily only one leading counsel‚ assisted by
subscriptores, for the impeachment3 for the defence there
were several (usually four) counsel-in-chief, all called patroni.
The arrangement was that each speaker should reply to a
single charge (Brut. ξ 207 sqq.); the last speech was called
peroratio: cf. Brut. ἓ 127 eoestat eius peroratio, qui epilogus
