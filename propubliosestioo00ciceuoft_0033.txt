of his speech (peroratio ἕ 144), the orator in c. 45 ff.
introduces a still longer episode, containing a kind
of political dissertation on the nature and position of
the ‘ caste’ (natio) of optimates (to use an expression
of Vatinius), on which some sneering reflections had
been made by the prosecutor, and he glorifies them as
the true friends of the people and protectors of their
country, in contrast with the selfish and tyrannical
demagogues (populares). With this episode the orator
very adroitly interweaves an account of his own glo-
rious restoration, in answer to the remarks which the
prosecutor had made about it and the way in which it
had been accomplished, and thus an admirable finish
is given to the preceding description of his exile.
The episode, it is true, has the appearance of being
brought in somewhat violently and spun out to a
disproportionate extent, but this defect, if it is a
defect, may be excused in consideration of the orator's

⁷ brilliant description. It may be assumed also that

this part of the speech was not fully elaborated until
after delivery.
