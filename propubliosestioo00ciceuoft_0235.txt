servative party, and points out to them that as long as they
pursue a timid policy, i.e. as long as political trials such as
the present are possible, so long their adversaries, the radical
party, will have no occasion to be afraid for themselves.

aedile] P. Clodius.

l. 32. diem dixit, ‘ gave him formal notice of the impeach-
ment,’ the first step of the procedure in state-trials, when a
magistrate ‘named a day’ in a concio, on which he would
summon the Comitia for the purpose of instituting proceed-
ings. Milo appeared before the burgesses in answer to the
charge on the 2nd of February, Β.0. 56, Clodius having been
chosen aedile on the 22nd of January, Intr. ξ 24. For an
explanation of the reason why the charge de vi was brought
immediately before the people, see Intr. ξ 37. accusavit,
‘stated the charge against,' ‘undertook the prosecution of.’
Milo's trial was postponed to the Quirinalia, Feb. 17, and
further adjourned until May the 7th, so that he was still reus
when Sestius was aoquitted on March the 14th (ep. ad Qu, fr.
11 3). The prosecution was finally dropped by Clodius. We
have here an instance of the unusual construction, when an
object common to two verbs, governing different cases (diem
dixit takes the dative), is governed by the second, cf. below,
§401. 17, Sallust Cat. 51, 38 imitari quam invidere bonis
malebant, Liv. xxxv 19, 6 odi odioque sum Romanis, and
other instances quoted by Nagelsb. lat. Stil. ἕ 90 b. So in
Greek, aS Plat. Apol. Socr. p. 34 G ἐδεήθη τε καὶ ἱκέτευσε τοὺς

see above ξ 88 l. 4, 1. 32. in rem publicam, ‘for state
business‚' not ‘in relation to the state.’

1. 4. quonam suas mentis conferent, ‘whither will they
turn their thoughts ?' ‘ what will they think of it?' monu-
menta publica] the porticus or colonnade, which Q. Catulus
after his victory over the Cimbri (B. c. 101) built on the site of
the house of M. Fulvius Flaccus, the contemporary of Gaius
Gracchus, adjoined Cicero’s house and was demolished by Clo-
dius, to-enlarge the site of his intended mansion.
