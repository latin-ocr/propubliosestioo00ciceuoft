INTRODUOTION xix

ς 14. But the opposite party adopted violent
measures against these proceedings 3 Clodius would
not allow Ninnius to address the people on behalf of
Cicero; Gabinius, the consul, forbade the deputation
from the Equites 130 approach the senate, and even
banished one of them, L. Lamia, who had shown par-
ticular attachment to Cicero, two hundred miles from
the city. He abused Hortensius and Curio for hav-
ing been present at the gathering of the Equites 011
the Capitol, and taken part in the deputation. Clo-
dius went still further 3 he made the delegates appear
at the assembly of the people on the pretence that he
would allow them to speak, and exposed them when
there to rough usage at the hands of his hired gang¹⁸.

ing of the people¹⁰ outside the Pomerium in the
Circus Flaminius, in order 130 obtain the opinion of
Caesar who was cum imperio. The consul Piso was

= also there. He had been prevented by indisposition

from taking part in the proceedings of the last few
days, after 016610, against whom he had hitherto
shown no hostility, had with indignant disdain rejected
his advice to leave Rome. Being asked by Clodius
what he thought of the proposed rogation, Piso

9ladiis et capidibus obiecit: cf. also or. de domo sua ξ 54 cum
eos, qui in conventu virorum bonorum verba de salute mea fecerant,
adesse iussisti, eorumque advocationem manibus ferro lapidibus
discussisti, tum profecto ostendisti vim tibi ‘maxime displicere,-
