xiv INTBOD UOTION

The senate ⁷, upon the matter being laid before them,
referred it to the pontifical college, who pronounced it
an offence against religion and declared that Clodius
ought to be put on his trial, and it was therefore

resolved to propose a bill (royatio) to the Popular
Assembly for regulating the trial. Τ116 consuls moved

for the appointment of an extraordinary tribunal, in
which the iudices should be selected by the Praetor
himself, and not, as usual, by lot. But the bill was
defeated through the influence of the party of Clodius,
the senate, on the recommendation of Hortensius, yield-
ing at length to the proposal of the tribune Q. Fufius
Calenus that he should be tried by an ordinary jury
taken from the three decwmlae iudicum and not by a
special jury selected by the Praetor. Clodius was
then arraigned by P. Cornelius Lentulus Crus, but
acquitted, by means of bribery and intimidation, by
a majority of thirty-one to twenty-five. Cicero had
the courage to appear as a witness, asserting that
he had seen Clodius in his own house on the very
day of the religious ceremony, three hours before he

pretended to have been at Interamna (Terni) about
ninety miles from Rome.

ἓ 7 . Eager to wreak his vengeance upon Cicero,
Clodius now sought to arm himself with more formid-
able power by becoming a tribune of the people. For
this purpose it was necessary that he should bc
adopted into a plebeian family3 as he was sui iuris,
i.e. of full age and not in the power of his father, who
was dead, this adoption could only be effected by the
