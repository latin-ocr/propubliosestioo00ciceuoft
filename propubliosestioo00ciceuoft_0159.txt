,’ What was Cicero to do in such circumstances 3 1 f he resolved
on extreme measures and opposed force to force, and one enemy
Clodius, like a second Catilina, whose scatte-red forces he had
reunited‚ was yot rid os, there were many more behind to be
conquered and to avenye that enemy's death, so that neither
his victory nor his sall would have restored the peace of the
state (ἐξ 42-44). He yielded therefore to the necessity os the
times and determined to yive way before his various enemies
rather than endanyer the existence of the state by stayiny (§§ 45-
—47). Not that he was afraid of death, which indeed would have
been to him rather a boon, but his life was of some consequence to
the state, and to sacrifice it wantonly would have been a derelic-
tion of duty to his country ; for he could not fail to be recalled,
ij he retired for a time, whereas his extinction would have been
as great a triumph to the enemies of order, as his restoration
was to the enemies of disorder, while it was an earnest of future
security, peace and ylory to the commonwealth (ἐξ 48-52).
