Cic. says etiam, because some denied Pompeius the credit of
terminating the servile war. M. Licinius Crassus had con-
quered the followers of Spartacus in a regular battle at Silarus
in 13.c. 71, but about five thousand of them, who escaped to
Gaul, fell into the way of Pompeius on his return, who destroyed
them all and wrote to the senate to say that he had pulled up
the war by the roots. Cf. ep. ad Att. 1, 14.

1. 19. accessit ad causam publicam, ‘took up the cause of

‘by his moral influence,’ not potestate ‘official authority,' be-
cause he was only privatus. The difference of meaning in the
two words appears clearly from or. in Pis. ξ 8 ille desiynatus
consul, cum quidam tribunus pl. suo auxilio mayistros ludos
contra sotum facere iussisset, privatus fieri vetuit, atque id
quod nondum potestate poterat, obtinuit auctoritate.
