NOTES

ἕξ 1, 2. Exordium

The obJ‘ect of the Exordium is to arouse the interest and
awaken the sympathy of the jury .· Cicero accordingly points
out the momentous issues at stake in the present trial. ‘It
ouyht not' he says ‘to be a matter of surprise if there be ,a
dearth of men willin9 to risk their lives for the public ,qood and
tranquillity, when they see the melancholy position to which
tlwse who have so nobly rescued their country from the party of
disorder are reduced by their adversarie-‘3’ persecution. The
worst part of it is that these men are now with a full sense
of personal security actually relyiny on the courts of justice to
enable them to commit injustice by effectiny the ruin os the true
and loyal citizens, ayainst whom their hired ruffia‘ns and despe-
radoes have so far been employed in vain. l am bound by the
ties of duty and ,qratitude to do all in my power to defend the
objects of these iniquitous attacks, and especially Sestius, who
was one os the most active in promotiny my recall from exile)
