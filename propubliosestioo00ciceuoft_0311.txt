ADDENDA ET OORRIGENDA

P. 3, ἓθ, 1. 14. eo auctore] ‘1 cannot think‚’ says Mr
Reid, ‘ that the words are used in their legal sense here.' Cic.

is merely praising Sestius for submitting dutifully to his
father's wishes.

P. 4, §L 1. 3. provinciali abstinentia] fully illustrated

, by Wickert, iiber d. Gebrauch des adjectiv. Attrib. etc. Berlin,

Weidmann‚ 1877. J. s. R.

’ Ρ. 8, ἓ 16, 1. 7. lege curiata] The case of Clodius seems to
fall under the head of deminutio capitis. Being sui iuris he

1 was adopted by a plebeian. J. s. R.

Ρ. 9, §la 1. 10. purpura] (3611 in the new edition of
Becker’s Gallus refers to Nepos in Plin. n. h. 1x 137, where it

ἶ is stated that the aedile P. Lentulus Spinther in Β. c. 63 was
¹ the first to wear Tyrian purple on the praetexta ; also Cic. or.

in Cat. 11 5, or. p. Cael. ξ 77 ; both Augustus and Nero issued
edicts restricting the use of the Tyrian purple to magistrates.
J. s. R.

§·18, 1. 27. adfluens] Η6 has afluens.

Ρ. 18, ἓ39, 1. 27. Μ. Scaurum] As to Saturninus I would
remark that the optimates always had some official explanation

’ of the (to them) strange fact that any man of ability should

 

take .the popular side. Neither this story of Saturninus
nor the similar story of Tib. Gracchus concerning the treaty

1 of Numantia is worthy of credit. J. s. R.

P. 19, ἓ 40, 1. 20. causae dictionem] These words have an

= odd look. If genuine, they must refer to a criminal trial

(cf. causam dicere); but the only two kinds of criminal trial
(iudicium populi and iudicium publicum) have been already
mentioned. Are the words a gloss? J. s, R.

P. 20, ξω, 1. 32. meum—vestro] Fleckeisen in Neue J.
for 1875 p. 856 contends that it is a logical necessity to read
me here for meum: he quotes or. p. Planc. ἐξ 86, 89. J. s. R.
