η attained the diynity os, a seat in the senate, provincials,

’ men of business and even freedmen; all who are free from

crime or debt, all who are not mad or vicious (§§ 96—98).

ἢ In their endeavour to support the national honour and institu-

tions the optimates have to counteract the revolutionary ten-

3 dencics of society, sor in a larye population there must inevi-
, tably be some whom quia, passion or pecuniary embarrassment
χ drive to despair, and who seelc for a remedy of their own mis-

sortunes by aflitatiny for a chansye os gyovernrnent. The yreatest

¹ wisdom and the utmost vi9ilance in its rulers are necessary sor

the protection of the state ayainst the violence and disorder of

ἶ such revolutionists ; Cic. says he knows from experiencc better
’ than most men how difficult and thorny the task is. The assail-

ants are more viyorous and earnest than the defenders, whose
apathy sometimes lets the evil ‚qrow until it is beyond their
control. Weak and vacillatiny champions are of no use in such
circumstances .- only bold and viyorous men can make asuccessful
resistance and restore order. Such saviours of society have been

, found at various times in men like M. Scaurus, Q. Metellus,

Q. Catulus ,· worthy examples sor those who aspire to ylory and
do not shrink from labour and perseverance (ἐξ 99-102). The
present time, however, contrasts favourably with the past in
this respect; there is no lonyer room for discontent and seditious
ayitation, as there was in the early period when the interests of
the optimates and the people at lar9e were at variance. Men
now-a-days are satisfied, pro-ud of their country and of the
optimates, and want nothing] but peace and tranquillity: and
agitators for a revolution can only secure recruits by bribery.
There would be a yeneral unanimity of opinion in political
matters but for these revolutionists and their hired ,qanys (ἕξ 103
-106). This may be seen in the conciones (ἕξ 107-109), in
the comitia, both legislative (ἕξ 110-112) and electoral (§ 113
-114), in the theatre (§§ 115—123), and the yladiatorial
shows (§§ 124—127), where on all occasions the people have
manifested their appreciation of the optimates and their sym·
pathy with my cause.

³ Then follows (ἐξ 127-131) a reply to what the prosecutor
had insinuated about the mode of Cicero's restoration, which he
designated as haviny been effected by violent and unjustifiable
means‚· and Cicero takes this opportunity of continuiny the
description of his splendid and triumphant return, which had
been interrupted at ἓ 7 7.

After a violent invective ayainst the witness Vatinius, with
whom the disparayiny phrase ‘caste' of optimates oriyinated,
Cicero concludes this part os the speech with a resume of what
he had said about them, and an exhortation to the youny to
imitate the 9reat and immortal statesmen of old, who ‘scorned'
deliqhts and lived laborious days,' and risked their lives in the
