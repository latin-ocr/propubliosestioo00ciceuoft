With Introduction, Explanatory Notes and Critical Ap.
pendix by the Rev, Euam A. HoLDEN, M.A.‚ LLD. Third
Edition revised. 5⁸. (Macmillan’s Classical Series.)

“Dr Holden has produced an excellent edition of the life of Plutarch he
has selected. His notes remove every difficulty of construction and point
out every illustration that the text affords of the grammatical principles
contained in the truly valuable grammar of Goodwin, to which constant
reference is made.”-Dublin Eveniny Mail, Feb. 21, 1882.

“ The notes generally are, as of course was to be expected from a scholar
of Dr Holden's eminence, excellent, precise, and happily illustrated by parallel
passages.”—Educational Times, May 1882.

“-Put the book into the hands of a scholar sufficiently advanced to be able
to read by himself and he will find here a vivid picture of a most important
figure in Greek history, an instructive commentar in Greek, and a storo ot ’
informa-tion about Greek antiquities,”—Journal os ἓάαεαεὶοη, May 1882.

‘⁶ Mr Holden has spared no labour to make his work as complete as

ossible. The introductionis exceedingly well done, and a very fair estimato
1s given of Plutarch's strength and weakness as a biographer. The pages on
the sources of information accessible to Plutarch are inm-active, both with
reference to the value of his work and in a more general way, as treating of
the credibility and importance of previous writers. Mr Holden is so well
known as a scholar that it is hardly necessary to speak of the excellence of his
verbal critieism.·¹—Saturday Revtew, May 17, 1882.

“ Thoroughly well done.”-Guardian, J uly 19, 1882.

“It is refreshing to come upon a piece of work so thoroughl well done
as this. Dr Holden has done a great service to English schoolmasters
and to Enghsh Scholars generally in producing this excellent edition, which
is a worth com anion—and we could hardly give it a higher praise—to
his ‘De O ciis! r Holden does not subscribe to what we have alwavs
considered the pestilent heresy of ‘Short Notes for School Use.' At the
same time the commentar-y is so skilfully arranged and so carefully indexed
that any boy who is fit to read the text at all will find with the utmost
ease all he wants. The introduction brings together in a few vivid pages
all that can be known of ‘le biographe de l'antiquite [(ὶιιί] n’a pas de
biographie,’ and adds, besides a masterly criticism‚ a most in eresting sketch
of Plutarch’s position in literature. We must not omit to add that Dr Holden
who is equally thorough in all departments, has a valuable appendix on the
text.”-spectat0r, Nov. 11, 1882.

“The edition is a very com ete one in all respects, and well ualifled
to meet the purposes for which i is intended.’'-Glasyow Heraea, June ‚ 1882.

“L'edizione e corretta: e di molto maggior-e eleganza che non sogliono

{33¹2} ll'gdilsggge scolastiche in Italia e in Germania.”—La cultura, Roma.
