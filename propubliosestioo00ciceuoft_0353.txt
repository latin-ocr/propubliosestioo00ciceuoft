(Macmillan’s Classical Series.)

“This is a very useful edition of a speech which well deserves to be brought
into prominent notice. The indexes are so full as to make quite an important
feature in the work. There is an excellent introduction and a valuable critical

of the oration pro Plancio. There is the same fulness of grammatical expla-

“Dr Hiill'den has applied himself with admirable thoroughness to the work
of editing the pro Sestio ‚· and, if the main obstacle to the study of this brilliant
and interesting speech has been, as we imagine, the want of a> good English
commentary, we may safely predict for it a greater popularity in future. ln his
Introduction, which is a model of clearness, Dr Holden sketches the men and
events of the troubled years 59-57 13.c.‚ leaving on the mind a vivid impression
of the period, and in the main a Just one. The rather complicated argument ol
the speech is well summarised at the close of the Introduction and the more
detailed analyses given in the course of the notes are very well done. At the
end of the volume are two valuable indexes, which the preface justly calls
‘unusually complete’. ’θ '¹‘ ἦ The scholarly thoroughness of his work and
its generally high merit cannot fail to secure for it a ready acceptance and
lasting popularity.”—J0urnal os Education,·Dec. 1, 1883. 1

‘⁴ This oration, one of the most characteristic of Cicero's finished style, and
abounding with points of interest connected with Roman life and politics, is
seldom read in our Schools or Universities. Mr Holden's excellent edition, by
supplying the means of studying it with advantage, ought to render it more
popular. He has spared no pains to produce a thoroughly trustworthy and
useful book. The Introduction is very full and clear, and the notes are numer-
ous and satisfactor . Points of Latin construction are explained with great
care and illustrate by numerous parallel passages from Cicero himself and
other Latin authors. An excellent grammatical index, arranged analytically‚
affords an eas means of reference to the points elucidated.”—The Schoolmaster,

August istu, 883.

“Cicero's Oration for Publius Sestius has been edited by Dr Holden hi a
painstaking and scholarly manner ὕ ⁴* ὕ ⁴* ὓ * ’θ '‘

His comments are so clear and so much to the point that there are very few
that we should desire to dispense with even in a schoolbook. The publication
of this edition should make the oration better known.”—School θαανάίαη,
