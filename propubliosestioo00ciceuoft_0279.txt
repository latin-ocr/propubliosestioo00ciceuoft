potestatem faceret bina paria e suo ludo postulandi, eaque
novissima aulico apparatu in d u c e re t.

1. 17. pulcherrimus] a hit at the ugliness of Vatinius,
especially his wen (struma); see note on ς 135 1. 16.

si ob eam causam peccaret, ‘if that were his reason for
doing wrong (i.e. because he had a fine set of gladiators to
boast of), in his eagerness to gratify the people in return for
his recent preferment (to the aedileship)‚ still that would be
no excuse3 but when he did not take even the best that the
market offered, but some which he bought from the eryastulm
whom he dignified with the names of gladiators, making some
⁴ Samnites‚’ according to chance and not by rule, others ‘pro-
vocatores,' does he not shudder to think what must be the out-
come of all this independence of spirit and defiance of the
established laws ?’

l. 19. beneficio] ironically, ἓ 54 1. 10 n.‚ g 74 1. 30.

l. 20. venalibus, ‘ those who were offered for sale' by man-
gones upon the catasta in the slave-market (Tibull. 11 3, 60,
Stat. silv. 11 1, 72, Pers. Sat. VI 77), which would be the least
valuable portion of their stock (mancipia viliora). The more
precious were disposed of in private shops. Ramsay R. A.

1. 21. ergastulis] the er9astulum‚ ‘workhouse,’ was a sort
¹of dungeon or place of correction attached to most country
villas and farms for the purpose of confining refractory slaves,
‹who were kept in setters (compediti) ε the rest, who were not
chained, were provided with separate accommodatiori (cellae,
contubernia) in other parts of the establishment. These private
prisons were entirer suppressed by Adrian and succeeding
emperors.

nominibus gladiatoriis] Gladiators were divided into
various classes according to their weapons and mode of
fighting, and were in many cases named from the nation
whose characteristic arms they bore, as Samnites, Thraces,
Galli, secutores, myrmillones, retiarii, laquearii, essedarii
(ξ 1261. 2), διο. The Samnites wore no doubt the armour of
the old Samnites, as described by Livy rx 40, 1¹7 Campani
ab superbia et odio Samnitium yladiatores, quod spectaculum
inter epulas erat, eo ornatu armarunt Samnitiumque nomine
compellarunt, i.e. after their defeat by the dictator Papirius
Cursor in Β.ο. 310. Of. Oic. Tusc. 11 541, de orat. 11 ς 325,
Hor. ep. 11 2, 98. We know nothing of the armour or·
mode of fighting, by which the provocatores were characterised.
They are often mentioned in inscriptions. Farlanetto (lapide
