This appears to have been sometimes done. J. s, Β.]

1. 7. dignissimum re publica] whose organ the senate
must be considered. nihil de me actum esse 1ure] see or.
p. dom. sua c. 26, de legg. 111 ξ 45; quo verius in causa nostra
vir mayni inqenii summaque prudentia, L. Cotta, dicebat nihil
omniuo actum esse de nobis; praeter euim quam quod
omnia illa essent armis ,qesta servilibus, praeterea ‘neque tributa
capitis comitia rata esse posse ‘neque ulla (i. e. neither tributa
nor centuriata) privileyii (i.e. quibus privilegium irroga-
retur). Quo circa nihil nobis opus esse leges de quibus nihil
omnino actum esset leyibus.

1. 10. non modo ferri sed ne iudicari quidem posse] The
negative in rna—quidem extends its infiuence to the preceding
clause. See ς 20 1. 1, n. on or. p. Plane. ξ 30 1. 33. What had.
befallen Cicero was not a case of iudicari, but of ferri without
the employment of provocatio and a plebiscite based upon it
(Introd. ἓ 11). Cotta’s argument then was that a man could
not even be tried, much less deprived of his citizenship, except
by or under the authority of the comitia centuriata.

l. 11. vim fuisse mam, ‘ that the proceeding at that time ³
was a violent one. For ille see n. on ξ 37 1. 4.

1. 12. [flammam quassatae rei p.‚ the clause is abruptly
introduced, and the mixture of metaphors is too bold even for

Cicero: rei publ-icae flamma, temporum flamma and the like
occur, but nothing resembling flamma quassatae ‘rei publicae.

The fault seems to lie in quassatae, and ac must be put before .

flammam. J. Β. 3.]

1. 13. lure iudiciisque] ius is the ‘right, ‘the law3’ iudi-

cium ‘the tribunal,’ or proceeding where or by which the =

right is contested and declared. There were two functions per-
fectly distinct and usually entrusted to different hands, the
mayistratus and the iudex. To the former belonged the func-

tions described by the words edicere, ius ἀίων-6,· to the iudex ξ

those expressed by the word iudicare. The functionary who
had the iurisdictio, i.e. the magistrate, was clothed with state
power3 but the judge was a simple citizen appointed to each

particular case to decide the matter at issue, selected from the ;
class of citizens qualified under the constitution to exercise ῑ
that function, and his powers were imparted to him by the 2

magistrate. The magistrate exercised his jurisdiction, in

view of all the people, seated on his tribunal, generally in the ;
forum3 the jud ge examined and decided the suit in the forum ῗ

also or some other public place, seated on his subsellium.
