1. 32. ab universo populo] The senators owed their places
- to popular election indirectly, because qualification for admis-

, sion to the senate was by. election to some magistratus (includ-

ing the quaestorship) by the people, and formal admission

j thereto by the Censors. ‘ Gicero,’ says Long, ‘has well marked
’ the character of the Roman Senate. It was not a body con-
· sisting of nobles who claimed a place by hereditary title, but
Ν.. by merit, at least such merit as is implied by the fact of
st popular election. It was a body which always subsisted
(sempiternum), though it was always changing, and every

Roman might get a place in it. Looking at it historically‚

⁸ we must admit that it was a wise body and that Rome owed

to it her long period of existence. If the senate had been

f} elected directly by the people, and for a limited time, the
Roman state would neither have grown nor lived? cf. or. in
r Verr. Π 11, 25 qui honos non homini solum debetur, sed primum
