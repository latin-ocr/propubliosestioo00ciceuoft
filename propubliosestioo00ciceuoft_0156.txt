1. 26. isdem consulibus] Halm thinks that some participle
must be supplied such as tacentibus or quiescentibus or coniven-
tibus, corresponding to the two participles sedentibus and inspec-
tantibus, but perhaps Mr Reid is right in suggesting that it is
a dative oi' the persons interested, ‘ for these same consuis!

l. 27. intemplum castoris] The temple of Castor and
Pollux was on the South-western side of the Forum Romanum
between the Basilica Sempronia and the Temple of Vesta. It was
first begun by the Dictator Aulus Postumius in nc. 494 after
the battle of the lake Regillus in the Latin War, and dedicated
by his son in Rc. 484. It was restored (1) by L. Metellus
Dalmaticus in Β,0. 119, (2) by Drusus and Tiberius in Λα). 6.
The Temple was often used for meetings of the Senate3 and
the fiight of steps which led up to it afforded a convenient
place ior the delivery of harangues (contiones) to the crowds in
the Forum. Bibulus, when he tried to oppose Caesar who
was speaking here, was thrown down the steps by the mob and
escaped with difficulty. On account of the height of its base-
ment it commanded the Forum and was frequently occupied by
troops or bodies of insurgents during the Gracchan and Clo-
dian riots. Clodius’ mob tried to convert it into a fortress by
pulling down the steps, when the voting upon the leyes Clodiae
took place. Cf. below ξ 85, or. in Pis. ξ 11 arma in templo
