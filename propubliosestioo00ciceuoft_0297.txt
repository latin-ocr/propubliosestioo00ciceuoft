APPENDIX ΟΝ THE TEXT

A Generaz Remarks

'rm Vulgate text of this Speech is that which having been
gradually formed by the scholars of the l5th, 16th, and 17 th
centuries, was further improved by Graevius, Ernesti,
Schiitz ‚ and others, until it appeared under its best form in
the edition of Orelli, commenced at Zurich in 1826 and com-
pleted in 1837, and re-edited by Baiter and Halm in 1845-
1861. Orelli had the advantage os the Scholia Bobiensia,
an ancient commentary contained in the Vatican palimpsest
of the 4th or 5th century, discovered and edited by Angelo
Mai, concerning which see my edition of the Planciana p. 205.
The volume containing Halm's text of this speech appeared
in 1856.

The text of the present edition of the Sestiana is founded
mainly upon that of Kayser as given in Vol. V of the edition
of Cicero's entire works by J. Gr. Baiter and G. L. Kayser,
and published by Bernhard Tauchnitz at Leipzig in 1862.
Kayser’s text is chiefly derived from a Paris MS (P 7794) of the
9th century, which is the only high-class ΜΒ that contains
the whole of the speech. The insertions by a later hand of
the 12th century to fill up lacunae, where existing, are of
little or no value. The Ms was carefully collated by Halm.
The next in value but altogether inferior is codex Bernensis
(B) of the 12th century. In addition to Kayser's text I have
also consulted that of A. Eberhard and W. Hirschfelder

³, in their second edition of X1x select orations of Cicero
*y (Teubner, Leipzig, 1878). The volume containing this speech

in the Teubner recension of Cicero's works by G. F. W. Miiller
(1886) did not appear in time for my first Edition.

In preparing my explanatory notes I have been largely
indebted to Karl Halm 's separate edition of this speech,
which contains a copious selection of the notes of earlier com-
mentatore, P. Manutius, N. Abrami, Ferratius, Gara-
