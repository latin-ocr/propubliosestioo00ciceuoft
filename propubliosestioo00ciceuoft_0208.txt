1. 24. mtedula=mus agrestis rubeus, ‘a field-mouse,'
as it is explained by Servius on Virg. Georg. 1 181. See the
comm. on Hor. Ep. 1 7, 29, where Bentley proposed to read
nitedula for vulpecula. The man’s name Rufus, and perhaps
his tawny complexion and mean appearance and puny figure
may have suggested the comparison‚ while his ignobilitas
is hinted at in the phrase ex vepreculis extracta. Cf. or. in
Pis. ς 18 tu ea: tenebricosa popina consul extractus.

1. 26. ex deserto—insitus] Cic. is here ridiculing Atilius,
who by means of arroyatia not unattended by fraud, had
managed to get himself transferred from the qens Gavia into
the Atilia. To this transitus in aliam ,qentem the term inseri
is applied (in reference also to Serranus), in continuation of
the metaphor, from husbandry. It is uncertain where Cic.
makes Atilius come from, because the reading of the uss
after deserto viz. 9a'violaeliorea is unintelligible. Halm follows
Madvig in writing Gavii (Gavi) Oleli rure, as if to mark meta-
phorically the decayed condition of some particular family.

The uncertain cognomen Olelus is confirmed by an inscription .

found at Lyons. If the reading a calatis Gaviis (with a play
upon the words comitia calata and possibly upon the cognomen
Calatinus) be correct, Cic. means to say that Atilius had
been transplanted into the qens Atilia from the obscure Gavii,

who were summoned to give their approval of his so exchang- ⁷
ing into another gens. ,But as in a case of arroqatio it was ¹
not the Gavii but the Pontifices and the people that had to ,

be consulted, there is much probability in Mommsen's conJec-
ture a Galatis Gaviis, insinuating a Gallic descent. For
other coniectures about this difficult passage see cr. n..
