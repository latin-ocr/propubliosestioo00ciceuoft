the payment of six and one third asses ' the modius. This was
the fixed price at which the grain was sold to the citizens,
probably at the rate of 5 bushels a month, by the State accord·
ing to the frumentarian law of Gaius Gracchus 13.c. 123 (Plutarch
C. Gr. c. 5), renewed in the lex Terentia Cassia of 13.c. 73.
In Cicero's time the bushel (modius) was worth at least 3 ses·
tertii=12 asses. Clodius proposed to give the corn gratis
which would have caused a loss of nearly one fifth of the
revenues of the state (vectiyalia).

ἓ 56, 1. 4. eam legem] This refers to the proposal of Clodius
that no magistratus, when the popular assembly was summoned
for business, should have power to watch the heavens. ‘Dion's
statement‚' says Long, ‘ that Clodius proposed to get rid of this
practice that he might not be hindered in his design on Cicero
seems to be true. Thus were abolished the famous law or laws
named Aelia and Fufia, which as Cic. (or. in Vatin. ξ 23) says
