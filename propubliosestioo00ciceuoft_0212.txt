*178 PRO P. SESTIO ἐξ 74-75

Ρ. 37, 1. 1. ut scitis] Cic. appeals to those of the iudices

11ᾙίποτῖ senators and therefore present during the proceedings
spo en o .

l. 2. Gavianus] Cic. callshimby this agnomen ironically‚
as though he had become a member of the qens Atilia by formal
arroyatio and not by a fraud. The fashion was for those who

passed out of one ,qens into another to lengthen their old gentile
name by the addition of -anus,· see Ramsay R. A. p. 62 f.

cum esset emptus, ⁴ although he had been bribed to veto the 1

bill? 1100, adversative, ⁴ but...not.’

l. 3. noctem postulavit, ‘asked a night to consider‚' which
was a polite form of putting a veto, when it was not possible to
stave off a question by wasting the whole day in speaking (diem

dicendo eximere). See the passage from the letter to Atticae,
quoted in the next note.

1. 4. socer ad pedes abiectus, ‘his father-in-law (Gnaeus ἶ

Oppius Cornicinus) threw himself at his feet.’ In his J
letter to Atticus 1v 2, 4 Cicero speaks of his repeating this old s
trick o'f his, when there was a resolution before the senate 1

about the restoration of his house (011 Oct. 1 of the same ζ

year): cum ad Clodium ventum esset, cupiit diem consumere sed ⁴

odio et strepitu senatus coactus est aliquando perorare. Cum
fieret SCtum in sententiam Marcellini, omnibus praeter unum
adsentientibus, Serranus intercessit. De intercessione statim
ambo coss. referre coeperunt...Serranus pertimuit et Cornicinus
ad suam veterem fabulam rediit.- abiecta toya se ad
9eneri pedes abiecit. Ille noctem sibi postulavit,-
non concedebant .· reminiscebantur enim Kal. Ian.

1. 5. postero die] at the next sitting of the senate.
moram facturum] ἓ 129 1. 18.

1. 6. 1111 deliberatori, ‘ that man of hesitation.’

1. ’7. ionga interposita nocte, ‘after the intervention of a ,
long night indeed.’ He means of course the whole time his
adversaries gained by the adjournment of the question. ‘ There ῑ
were, it is true,’ he continues, ‘only a few more days in January ,ἐ
011 which the senate could be held3 but on all these days ι
nothing was discussed but the subject of my restoration.’ The l
days on which the senate could meet were the Kalendae Jan„ ³
1v Non.. the Nonae, the vn and π Idus and 111, xvn, xvr
Kal. Feb. The last days were comitiales, on which it was not ἒ
usual for the senate to sit.

1. 8. consecuti = consecuti enim. pauc omnino...
sed tamen, ‘ few to be sure...but,’ see n. to ξ 84 1. 8. ’
