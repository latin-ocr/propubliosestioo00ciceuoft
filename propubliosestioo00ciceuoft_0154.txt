ne auspicia cet.] the reference is to the lex Aelia et Fufia,
of the time and authors of which we have no exact informa·
tion, except that Cic. tells us that it was passed about 100
years before the consulship of Piso and Gabinius (Am-c. 695
=13.c'. 58). It is doubtful whether there was one law only
or two, the one being supplementary to the other. One of
the chief provisions of the lex Aelia was, that any of the
superior magistrates should have the right on the days when
the comitia were held to watch the heavens (servare de caelo),-
and, if they saw lightning, to report this (obnuntiareJto the
presiding magistrate. The augure had not this right of spectio*
(or. Philipp. 11 ξ 81) but only the magistratus, whose bare an-
nouncement to the presiding magistrate that they were engaged
in watching the heavens‚ se servaturos (or servasse) de caelo,
was enough to make the comitia impossible for the day. The
object and effect of these laws was to prevent rash and hasty
legislation‚ by empowering every magistrate to stay proceedings:
hence Cic. speaks of them as propugnacula murique tranquilli-
tatis et otii (or. in Pison. ξ 9), and asserts that (or. in Vat. 9 18)
frequently tribunicios furores debilitarunt et represserunt.

The clause ne quis leyi intercederet does not point to any new
provision in the lex Aelia ; it is only a rhetorical amplification
of the consequence of obnuntiatio, by which the higher magis-
tratus -had obtained a means of repression similar to that which
the tribunes had in virtue of their intercessio, So that the two
clauses together=ne quis obnuntiando leyi intercederet.

The fourth clause ut omnibus fastis diebus leye‘m ferri liceret
refers to a provision of the lex Fvfia (if indeed it differed from
the Aelia) which provided that the comitia should not be held
for legislation on all dies fasti. Clodius probably aimed at<
putting the legislative comitia on the same footing in this
