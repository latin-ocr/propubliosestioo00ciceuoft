ἒ1750 PRO P. SESTIO ἐξ 54-55

Clodius souyht to appear in the light of a benefactor to the people
but the real tendency of which was to relax the public discipline
at a time when it wanted most to be reinforced‚ and to set aside
many wise institutione of antiquity .·-(1) that the censore should
not expel from the senate or inflict any mark of infamy <m any
man who was not first openly accused and convicted of some crime
b their joint sentence; (2) the revival of the old campanies
(zonegia), which the senate had abolished, the incorporation os
new ones which miyht easily assume a political character,-
(3) that corn. should be distributed yratis to the citizens; (4)
the transfer of Gabinius from Cilicia to the wealthy province of
Syria ,· (5) the repeal of the lex Aelia Fufia, the only check upon
tumultuous assemblies that had subsisted for a whole century,
and which Cic. calls the bulwark and fortress of public tran·
quillity (ἐξ 55—56) ς (6) on the deprivation of the priest os Cybele
at Pessinus and the appointment of Broyitarus of Galatia in his
stead, and the conferriny of the title of kiny upon him ; (7) on
the restoration of certain eoeiles of Byzantium, whom their city
had driven out for crimes ayainst the public peace ; (8) on the
deprivation of Ptolomaeus, kiny os Cyprus, and the confiscation
of his whole estate—an unparalleled act of inJ'ustice, and the

appointment of Cato as eoetraordinary commissioner to carry ¹

out the law, which was really only a means of yettiny rid
os a troublesome adversary sor the remainder of his magistracy
and to yratify the vain desire of tarnishiny the reputation
of a man so distinquished (ἐξ 57-63). Ayainst these measures
the consuls, had they done their duty to the state, ouyht to have
protested ,· what could be eaepected of men who stood aloof when

a yrievous injustice was beiny done to a citizen who had deser-ved .

so well of his country as I had (ξὲ 64—65). This state of thinys
miyht have continued and other mischievous and unconstitutional
laws been framed but sor the intervention of Pompeius, who,

haviny for some time stood aloof from public affairs, at lenyth Ἰ

declared aqainst Clodius (ξὲ 66-67).
