(350) civi immuni scis quid cantari solet? ib. 1 1, 2 (24)
amicum castiqare immoenest facinus. So in old Latin munis

= ‘obliging,' Mercat. prol. 105 dico eius pro meritis qratum me
et muuemfore.

1. 4. illud] referring to the preceding line. non enim
ing-rati sed miseri, sc. erant, ς 131 1. 6.

l. 6. quibus—non liceret] subjunctive in 8 causal clause.
unus—universi] or. Phil. 111 ξ 6 : quis enim unus sortior, quis
amicior umquam reip. fuit, quam leqio Martia universa?

1. 7. sed tamen=Gr. δ’ οὖν, ‘ but, be that as it may?
illud, ‘the following verse.' Cic. correcte himself after quot-
ing the first line, as if applicable to himself ( pro se), by which
he would appear to reproach his countryrnen with ingratitude‚
whereas they were, he says, unfortunate rather than ungrate·
ful. The next line, however, was so relevant to his own case
that the poet must, he says, have written it for him.

1. 8. actor] in twofold sense, as eyit in ς 120 1. 31.

l. 9. cum demonstraret=demonstrans, as in g 126

noun declaratio. Cf. §64 l. 1. in causa] g 102 l. 32.

1. 15. non popularis] ironically, as adding point to his
refutation of the opinion of his enemies about their own

popularity. equidem audiebam, ‘ I for my part go by
hearsay;’ ἕ 72 1. 30 vos haec melius scire potestis ; equidem
audita dico. [existimare ι perhaps a reference to the sense

iudicare, which has misled some of the writers of the inferior
mss to put aestimare. J. S. R.]

GHAPTER LVIII

ἓ 123, 1. 16. et quonlam] The sentence beginning with
histrio etc. is only a recapitulation of what precedes, the fresh
point to which Cic. here draws attention is contained in the
question utram haec Aesopum etc. huc, ⁴ to this point,'
‘so far?

L 17. tenens—ut, ‘in so many passages of the same
tragedy, that etc.’

l. 18. dolenter, ‘ pathetically,’ g 141. 8, cf. § 120 l. 3.
