168 PRO P. SESTIO §g 68-69

of January‚ the day fixed for the decision of the comitia
about his case (ἓξ 71-75); the attach on the tribunes Fabricius
and M. Cispius ,· the narrow escape of his brother Quintus Cicero ,⁰
the non-appearance of the tribunes Sestius and Milo on that
occasion (ξὲ 75-78); the subsequent attach of the Clodians on
Sestius in the temple of Castor, whither he had yone unprotected to
oppose some measure of the consul Metellus, on which occasion he
only escaped with his lise because they thouyht he was lcilled
(§§ 79—83); the determination of Sestius thereupon to protect
himself by lceepin9 armed men about him to repel force with force,
as Milo also did (ἕξ 84-85). Cicero's reply to the invidious
comparison suyqested>by the accuser between Sestius and Milo,
because Milo, before he proceeded to defend himself by main
force, had endeavoured to prosecute Clodius in a legal manner
(ἐξ 86-92). ‚The circumstance that the Senate itself did not
sanction this prosecution, thereby appeariny to leave its own
party in the lurch, the critical position of Cicero's defenders in
comparison with the successful situation of his opponents and the
question of Albinovanus founded upon this fact, who asked de'·
risively where the ‘caste’ of optimates, so hiyhly lauded by
Cicero, was really to be found (ξ 93)-αῑῑ these lead Cicero
to the fourth head, which treats of the optimates and their
relation to the populares (§§ 93—95).
