§2128 PRO P. SESTIO gg 38—39

‘the praetor ‘ made over ’ or awarded any property to a claimant.
Hence addictus was said of a debtor who had been given up as
servant or bondman to his creditor. Cf. Hor. Ep. 1 1, 14
nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri, Cic. Tusc, 11' 2, 5
certis quibusdam...sententiis quasi addicti...sunt eaque ‘neces-

sitate coacti ut etiam, quae ‘non probare soleant, ea coqantur
,constantiae causa defendere.

ἓ 39, 1. 25. quaestore ostiensi, ‘ when he held the pro'-
vincia Ostiensis as quaestor.’ The important colony of Ostia
at the mouth of the Tiber,founded by Ancus Marcius, was made
the station of a Roman fleet in B. c. 217 and was granted peculim·
exemptions on account of its importance to Rome, which it
furnished with its principal supplies of corn. It gave its name
to one of the four provinciae quaestoriae into which Italy was
divided. The other three were Calena or Callium (provin-
ὀἱα tacita et quieta or. p. Mur. ξ 13, Tac.Ann. lv. 27); Gallica
(ef. Plutarch Sert. 4, Sueton. Claud. 24); aquaria or Baiana

(or. in Vatin. ξ 12). The provincia Ostiensis was naturally ·

as Cic. tells us or. p. Mur. ἓ 18 negotiosa et molesta and there-

fore unpopular (cui, eum quaestores sortiumur, etiam adclamari
solet).

l. 26. per ignominiam] i. q. ignominiose: cf: per im·-
prudentiam or. p. Planc. ἓ 31 1. 9, per ridiculum de off. 1 ἓ 134
l. 6 where also see my note. principem—senatus] the sena-
tor whose name was placed first upon the roll of the
Censors bore this title, which was regarded as in the highest
degree honourable, but conferred no power or privilege.

1. 27. Μ. Scaurum] Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, the
son of highly aristocratic but not wealthy parents, raised himself
“to the consulship in B.c. 115 and. censorship in sc. 109. He
was long the chief of the Senate and the politica] oracle of his
order, and immortalized his name not only as an orator and
author, but also as the originator of some of the principal
public buildings and works, such as the via Aemilia, executed in
this century. In B.c. 112 he headed an embassy to J ugurtha
and afterwards took the post of a commander in the African
army sent against him under the consul Lucius Calpurnius
Bestia. The Numidian king obtained favourable terms of
peace by bribing the consul and his legatus, at which the
general indignation was so great that an extraordinary jury-
commission was appointed to investigate the high treason, of
which Scaurus himself, though a party in the guilty transac-
tion, was chosen one of the presidente. There are many lau-
datory notices of him in Cicero's works, When Lucius Appu-
