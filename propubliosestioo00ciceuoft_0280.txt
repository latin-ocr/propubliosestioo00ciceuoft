-246 PRO P. SESTIO §g 134—135

Patavine, n. 213 p. 217, identifies them with the secutores,
and infers from a passage of Artemidorus (Oneirocr. 11 33)
that they were so called because they did not maintain a
stand-up fight but a desultory combat. The gladiatore fighting
Ι with each other never belonged to the same class. Thus the

antagonists of the secutores were the retiarii. Ramsay R. A.
pp. 358—360‚ Guhl and Koner, p. 533 Engl. tr.

§135, 1. 25. defensiones, ‘excuses’ do, ‘I exhibit.’

bestiarios] men who fought in arms with wild beasts, but
were also gladiatore.

1. 26. lex] sc. Tullia, ἓ 133 1. 5. festive] sc. dictum,
‘ a pretty conceit‚’ as though bestiarii were not also gladiatores.

1. 27. aliquid etiam acutius, ⁴ something even more
clever.' dicet] i.e. I shall expect him to say.

1. 28. totam aedilitatem cet„ ‘ that all the costly prepara-
tion for his expected aedileship be transferred to this exhibition.⁷
Aedilitas=munus aedilicium3 cf. de off. 113 57 ut splendor
aedilitatum ab optimis viris postuletur.

1. 29. praeclara] ironical as often, or. in Pison. ἓ 17,
or. in Cat. 1 ξ 26, Tusc. 1 ξ 49. unus leo] a gladiator in the
band of Vatinius was called Leo according to the Scholiast,
who remarks ‘ hoc etiam dictum de Leone Tullius Tiro,
libertus eiusdem, inter iocos Ciceronis adnumerat! Cf. Lucian
Demon. c. 49 τοὺς νῦν ἀθλητὰς οἱ παρομαρτοῦντες λέοντας
καλοῦσιν. [Ι fancy the title Leo occurs on one of the ancient
mosaice (mostly from Hadrian’s villa at Tibur) representing
the armour and dresses. J. s· 3.]

1. 30. hac defensione] i.e. let him try to evade the law by
saying that his exhibition is one of bestiarii, not of gladiatores.

1. 31. tribunos plebis appellare] in virtue of their right
auxilii ferendi, but that had no legal validity in a postulatio
ex leye before the Praetor. Still there had been an instance
of such an appeal at an earlier period, when Gaius Antonius
Hybrida was accused by Julius Caesar in 13.0. 76 for his
oppression of Greece‚ but he was expelled the senate six years
afterwards by the censors for this offence‚ Mommsen R. H. Π
Ρ. 95, cf. or. in Vatin. ἓ 33.

1. 32. iudicium disturbare] as Vatinius had done, when
postulatus leye Licinia et Iunia in B.c. 58, because of his acta
tribunicia of 13.o. 59, he had to appear before the praetor Gaius
Memmius. of. or. in Vat. ξ 33 quaero etiam illud ex te,
postulatusne sis le9e Licinia et Iunia3...appellarisne tribunos
plebi, ne causam diceres, quod in hac rep. non modo factum
