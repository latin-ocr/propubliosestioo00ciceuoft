‘a consul, a praetor, 0 tribune of the people, put forth new
edicts of a new sort‘ that the accused do not put 111 011 appear-
01100, that he be not summoned, that no judicial enquiry be
made, that no person be allowed to speak of iudices or trials
at all.'’ The edict was that nothing of this kind should be
done until the appointment of the iudices by lot. The matter
is explained by Dio Cassius 39, 7 who says ‘Clodius was a
candidate for the aedileship‚ in order that, if he should be
elected, he might escape trial for disturbing 1110 peace, for
Milo commenced a prosecution against him but did 1101 bring
it 11110 court. For neither were the quaestors elected as yet,
whose business it was to determine the jury by lot, and
(Metellus) Nepos (the consul) forbade the praetor to admit any
prosecution before the jurymen, were appointed. And
as it was the rule that the aediles should be elected before the
quaestors‚ this circumstance was the chief cause 01 1110 delay, ’

Ῐ friends of Clodius wished to secure his election 10 the aedile-

ship, and as aedile elect he could not be tried during that year
(13.c. 57) except for ambitus, if any, at his election. But Milo’s
charge against him was brought under the lex Plautia de vi.
