quasi armorum studio] i.e. ‘on the pretence that he wished
to learn the use of arms (ὁπλομαχία)’ [or ‘ as though from a taste
for armed spectacles.’ J. s. 3.] So of Cethegus (or. in Cat. 3,
10), se semper bonorum ferramentorum studiosum fuisse.

P. 5, 1. 1. conventus] Capua, which in the year B. c. 3323
had obtained the Roman civitas sine suffra9i0‚ was punished
forits defection in the second Punic war by its dissolution as
a political community‚ and its population deprived of all the
rights belonging to it as such3 and all jurisdiction was placed
in the hands of a praefectus sent annually from Rome.
Liv. xxm 16 ceterum habitari tantum tamquam urbem Capuam
frequentarique placuit ; corpus nullum civitatis nec senatus nec
plebis concilium nec ma9istratus esse ; sine concilio publico, —
sine imperio multitudinem, nullius rei inter se sociam, ad con-
sensum inhabilem fore, Cic. de leg. agr. 11 § 89 maiores Capuam
receptaculum aratorum, nundinas rusticorum, cellam atque hor-
reum Campani aqri esse voluerunt. Now as such a place was
called conciliabulum, so its united inhabitants were called
conventus not populus or civitas. This state of things con-
tinued until B.c. 59, when, upon the motion of the consul
Caesar, a colony was led to Oapua3 therefore at the time of
the delivery of this speech (hoc tempore) the Gapuans were
coloni with a senate (decuriones) and two chief magistrates
(duumviri sc. iuri dicundo §19). Vell. Patere. 11 44 in hoc
consulatu Caesar leyem tulit, ut ayer Campanus plebei divide·

deducta et ius civitatis restitutum post annos circiter 01211, quam
bello Punico ab Romanis Capua in formam praefecturae redacta
erat ; cp. Caesar B. civ. 1 14, 4 dilectumque colonorum qui

1. 2. me unum patronum adoptavit] See Prof. Mayor's
note to or. Phil. 11 ἓ 107 l. 19. Strictly they had no right to

choose a patronus at all, being a multitudo ad consensum in· ,

habilis, but in practice the rule had long since been neglected.
We leam from Cicero’s speech against Piso ξ 25 that they
voted him also a gilded statue: quorum Capuae te praetexta-
tum nemo adspexit, qui non qemeret desiderio mei : cuius con-
silio cum universam remp„ tum illam ipsam wrbem meminerant
esse servatam. Me inaurata statua donarant; me patro-
