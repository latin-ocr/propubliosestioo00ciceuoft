tribunate. He had pledyed his word solemnly to Pompeius that,
when tribune, he would not take any measures aqainst Cicero,-
but not content with breakiny his promises, he must needs
threaten Pompeius himself (515). The fatal conseque-noes to the
state of the election of P. Clodius to the tribunate and his success
in securiny the countenance and assistance of the two consuls,
Aulus Gabinius and L. Calpurnius Piso, in his revolutionary
proJects (ἓ 17); Cic. paints the character of these two men in the
blackest colours, representiny them as a disyrace to their office,
and as ready to sacrifice the empire itself to their lusts and
pleasures ; the former he describes as a professed rahe, so despe-
rate in his fortunes that he had no other resouroes or hopes of
subsistence but from the plunder of the republic; of the latter he
says, that while affectiny the mien and ,qarb of a philosopher, he
,qot the credit os bein9 a patriot and reviver of the ancient dis·
eiphjm’ while he was in reality a mere sot and voluptuary (§ 18—-

Clodius secured these two sellers of their country by offerinq
to procure for them by a special 9rant of the people select and
lucrative provincial yovernments‚ instead os lettiny them take
their chance by lot as usual (§§ 24, 25), consequently the yeneral
protest ayainst the bill of Clodius affectinq Cicero himself, and
the appeal of the better sort to the consuls to interfere on his
behalf, was treated by them with the utmost derision: whereupon
the people showed their sympathy with Cicero by puttiny on
mourning] as a mark of respect. The senate itself when assembled
in the temple of Concordia condescended with suppliant entreaties
to implore the intervention of Gabinius, the only consul present,
only to meet with a rude and insulting] reception from him ; and
that auyust body passe-d a resolution sor chanyinq their dress
with the rest of the citizens in token of mourniny (§§ 25—27).
Gabinius' anyry address to the people and denunciatum os the
senate and equites, and his irreyular and arbitrary exercise of
power in banishiny one of them, L. Aelius Lamia, for his
distinquished zeal and activity in Cicero’s service (ἐξ 29-31).
(Apoloyy to the J'ury for this lengythy narrative, which Cicero
shows not to be irrelevant to the case of Sestius (g 31)): the
illeyal assumption of power by the consuls in forbiddiny the
senate to comply with their own resolution and enjoininy
them to resume their ordinary dress‚and theirscandalous conduct
in sacrifieiny the state by aidin9 and abettin9 Clodius in all his
desiym and votiny sor his lau-less measures (§§ 32—35).
