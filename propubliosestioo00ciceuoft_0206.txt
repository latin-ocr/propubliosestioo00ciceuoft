*172 PRO P. SESTIO gg 71-72

CHAPTER XXXIH

ἕ 71, 1. 3. hoc interim tempore] Cic. now resumes the
eketch of Sestius' early life, which had been intel-rupted with a
description of the turbulent period of the previous year B.c. 58

(g 15—§ 70).

1. 4. tribunus] see cr. n. 1te1· ad caesarem suscepit]
In 3.(3. 58 Caesar, after defeating the Helvetii and the German
Ariovistus, crossed the Alps into Gallia Cisalpina to make his
circuite (acl conventus ayerzdos b. G. 1 c. 54), and Sestius would
find him at the close of the year in North Italy. (Lony.)

1. 5. quid egerit] subjunctive of oblique question depend-
ent on nihil ad causam (est or pertinet), ‘it does not concern,
bear on, the case.’ Cf. the phrase ‘nihil ad rem, and for the
reference Introd. § 19. Translate: ⁴ his object, his success.’

1. 6. flle] sc. C. Caesar. aequus, ‘ favourable,’ ,
‘friendly.’ [fuerit can hardly be right: the cod. Ursin. had
fuerat .· either that or fuit seems needed. J. s. 3.] ³

1. 7. nihil ab hoc profectum, ‘that no good was got by .
him! Profectum is of course from proficio, not proficiscor.

1. 8. integ-ritatem, ‘singleness of purpose.’ Sed tamen
=Gr. δ’ οὖν, ‘be that as it may‚’ ‘ any hOW,' whatever the
result was, in reference to nihil ad causam.- sed tamen prae-
termittendum non fuit ut videatis etc. hominis]
ἕ 221. 16, ς 531. 18, ξ 881. 4.

1.11. ad concordiam civium] we gather from a letter of
Cic. to Lentulus that his return was not opposed by Caesar:
ad fam. 1, 9, 9 seque, quae de mea salute eyisset, voluntate
Caesaris eyisse ipsum meam fratrem testatus est Pompeius.

1.12. a causa non abhorrere] cf. or. de prov. cons. ξ 43
pertinere ad causam illam putabatis voluntatem Ο. Caesaris

{iglalute mea non abhorrere. For construction see ἓ 70

1. 13. abiit, ‘came to an end.’ cf. Ov. ep. ex Pont. 3, 4,
60: dam venit huc rumor...annus abisse potest. W. Bauer and

E. Ortmann, cited by Halm 5, think that the words abiit ille ’
annus to perdidissemus 1. 19 should be transposed and placed ἔ
after 1. 29 de tabula sustulit ; because the consuls did not π

retire from their office before J an. 1, while the tribunes entered
on their office on Dec. the lOth.

1. 14. nondum re sed spe rel publicae recuperandae, i. q. ’

cum nondum re res p. esset recuperata sed spes ’
