PRE FAOES

IN preparing this edition of Cicero's Sestiana I have
followed 13110 same general plan as in the Planciana
(published in 1881 for 13110 Syndics of 13110 Cambridge
University Press), which has been very favourably
noticed in English and Foreign Reviews.

The speech is 11013 0110 that is usually read. in
English Schools 01 even Universities, and yet 113
is full of interest. Ι13 contains some passages, espe-
cially those aboub M. CATO (c. xxvm) and about,
13110 different kinds of statesmen, as fine as anything
we have in Roman oratory3 and 1311010 is much
historic interest in 13110 lively sketch of 13110 state
of political parties ab one of 13110 most thrilling
periods. In short, it is a specimen of 13110 writer’s
best style, ‘naturaL direct, vivid, powerful, tremulous
with life and energy, perfect in form, genuinely Latin,
yet penetrated with 13110 Greek feeling for finish and
'clearne38‚' as Professor N ettleship well describes 113
