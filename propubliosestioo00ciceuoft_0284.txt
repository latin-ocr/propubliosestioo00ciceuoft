-.250 PRO P. SESTIO gg 137—140

just as amplitudo was to the senate (or. p. Planc.§ 121. 22),
and, next the tribuni aerarii, who according to the leoe Aurelia
of B.c. 70 formed the third decuria of the iudices. Most
modern editors accept Bake's alteration of the ms reading splen-
dore confirmari into splendorem confirmare. But Long refuses
to accept the emendation, maintaining that Cicero's meaning
is that the senate is supported by the splendidi equites, and
that, after giving the senate so high a position, it would not
have been consistent with good taste, to say nothing of truth,
to speak of the equites as depending for the preservation of
their splendor on the senate, instead of making them, as a
‘splendidus ordo,’ the support of that great body in which
was centered the administration and the dignity of the Roman
state.
