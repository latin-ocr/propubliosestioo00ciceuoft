1. 30. rei p. sanguine, ‘with the marrow of the state.⁹
saginantur] like gladiators3 cf. Tac. Hist. 2, 88: cinyulis ibi
militibus Vitellius paratos cibos ut yladiatoriam sayinam

sayiuae, i.e. ‘who will sell himself to be trained and coarsely
fed for a gladiator.’ de ipso accusatore] M. Tullius
Albinovanus. Quaerere in the sense of ‘to inquire,’ ‘seek

the information is sought.

Appius Claudius Pulcher is meant.
1. 5. plagam, sed eam, quam acceptam gemere posset,
