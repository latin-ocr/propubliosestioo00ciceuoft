vicis castellis cis Taurum montem usque ad Halyn amnem et a
valle Tauri usque ad iu9a, qua in Lycaoniam veryit: that is,
he was compelled to cede all his possessions in Europe and all
the territory in Asia Minor to the west of the river Halys through-
out its course, and of the mountain-chain of the Taurus, which
separates Cilicia and Lycaonia, so that he retained nothing in
the Anatolian peninsula but Cilicia. Mommsen Rom. Hist.‚Bk
